/*
* Efficient sorting algorithm. Can be 2-3 times faster than mergesort
* Logic: Divide and conquer algorithm. Pick an element (pivot) from the array. Partition the array into 2 sublists: everything smaller than the pivot to the left, everythigng else to the right. Apply this recursively to the sublists.
* Advantages: O(n lgn)
* Disadvantage: Worst case On^2 when pivot is left most elemetn and array is already sorted
